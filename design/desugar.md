# Desugaring Pass
The first proper backend pass of the Hoyle compiler is the desugarer. It performs a number of fairly trivial tasks to simplify the typed parse tree, but it also performs two critical and complicated tasks: the explicit insertion of reference counted indirections and erasure of generics. The resulting IR has no concept of parameterized types, instead it has an unsized `Any` type, which will never result in undefined behavior because the type checker already proved that there are no type errors. An issue remains though: Hoyle is a language with unboxed types, but if `Any` is unboxed, then it could have any size. If I have a `Pair[Any, int]`, I need to know the size of the `Any` to be able to access the `int` field. The solution is to introduce extra parameters to functions. If a function has *g* generic type parameters and *n* normal arguments, it will be compiled down to a new function with *g* + *n* arguments, where the first *g* arguments are structs containing data about the corresponding generic type, including the size, alignment, etc.
